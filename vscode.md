## VSCode

The text editor we'll be using in this course is called **VSCode**; it was
developed by Microsoft, and is highly extensible.

**Note: From this point forward you will open VSCode from the command line** with `code <path_of_file_or_dir_to_open>`

### VSCode Extensions and Settings

**During this script, VSCode will open for you. Follow the prompt in your terminal and close it when asked to.**

```bash
scripts/vscode.sh
```

If you get a `command not found` response in your terminal, you have not
installed shell commands correctly. Open VSCode and press CMD+Shift+P (or CTRL+Shift+P on Linux), then type 'shell command'. Click 'Install code command in PATH' and rerun the script.
