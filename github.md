## GitHub and Initial Setup

If you haven't done so already, go to [GitHub](http://www.github.com) and create
an account; be sure to write down your username and password somewhere, since
we'll be using these credentials later. Next, go to [GitHub Enterprise](https://git.generalassemb.ly) and create an account. It is recommended that you use the same username. This will be the source of your learning material throughout SEI, while your personal Github will be where you showcase your projects.


Now that you are set up with GitHub Enterprise, we want this repo on your local
computer. Please follow along as I show you how to fork, clone and put the repo
in the correct directory.

-   We need to download this repo. **An instructor will walk you through how
    to do this**. Make sure this downloads to your Desktop so we can easily
    find it later.

-   Unzip the downloaded installfest folder. It'll create a new folder, likely
    called `installfest-main`.

-   Open your terminal, and  navigate to your Desktop directory `cd ~/Desktop`.

-   Change into the newly created `installfest-main` directory by typing
    `cd installfest-main`. This directory contains another directory named
    `scripts/` containing scripts that we will run to set up our machines!

-   We will be running scripts from the root of the `installfest-main`
    directory. This means at any time, your current working directory should
    be `~/installfest-main/`. Do not change into any other directories within `~/installfest-main/`.
